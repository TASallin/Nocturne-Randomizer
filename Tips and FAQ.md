### FAQ

**Where is Black Frost?**
Black Frost's check was moved from Kabukicho prison to the Sakahagi cutscene in Asakusa because he would overlap with Mizuchi otherwise.

**Where is White Rider?**
Instead of Kalpa 3 unlocking the riders, you need to find the apocalypse stone. Arahabaki will tell you where it is if you talk to him in front of the Kalpa 3 hole. Additionally, White Rider will only appear in Shibuya instead of following you to every town.

**Why is Pixie level X?**
The starting Pixie can be a higher level to carry you through early game until you've set up builds. Without this, a lot of early bosses and dungeons like underpass can be extremely difficult.

**I don't know where any other bosses are**
Have you checked Troll in Ginza, or Bishamon 1 outside Asakusa? Don't forget about optional bosses like Mara and the Onis

**Is there an HD version of the rando?**
Currently no

**X boss had the wrong turn order?**
This can happen, as agility values can vary between boss locations

**Ongyo-Ki is acting wierd**
It's a known bug that Ongyo-Ki acts differently outside his vanilla location, but there's no plan to fix this. If a boss with multiple enemies spawns at his check, attacking one will remove the other enemies, and AOE skills will miss.

**Is Lucifer randomized?**
No, Lucifer will always be vanilla as fighting him in an early location is extremely difficult and often not very fun.

### Beginner Tips

* Use Buffs
* Use Mitamas to get good skillsets, especially with the double macca setting
* If you can't beat a strong boss, either you don't need to fight it yet, or there will be a magatama that helps against it somewhere you can check.
* You may want to save in a different file before entering amala network if you're not sure you can beat the boss
* Almost all bosses have hint messages telling who they are from their door or a nearby npc
