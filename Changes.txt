Version 0.2.0
Logic
* All bosses are now included in the randomizer
* The Ahriman and Noah checks don't work properly, so the Beelzebub and Metatron checks were moved to their location
* Noah and Lucifer are banned from SMC. Furthermore, Lucifer has lost 2/3 of his hp
* All bosses banned from SMC are also banned from amala network 1
* The Kaiwan and Berith checks no longer drop rewards
* Kagatsuchi gives no combat rewards, so it is also banned from having a reward
* The Archangels check has been added immediately after Futomimi, making Mifunashiro a boss rush
* Various underwhelming bosses are banned from the Kagutsuchi check: Specter 1, Troll, Orthrus, Yaksini, Thor 1, Kaiwan
* The futomimi check no longer requires all amala temple bosses in logic, so keys may appear at later parts of the game
* Rules have been updated: Mada -> null mind, Baal Avatar -> null curse, Girimekhala -> null mind or phys,
	Mizuchi -> null mind or ice, Red Rider -> resist phys, Black Rider -> null ice, Pale Rider -> null curse or death,
	Aciel -> resist phys, Samael -> null mind or nerve, Dante 1 -> resist phys, Lucifer -> null nerve


Boss Mechanics
* Bosses now copy the stats of their check directly, but boss extras do not unless it is a phase change
* Ongyo-Ki glitches into a better boss fight outside of his check
* If multiple enemies are at the Ongyo-Ki check, the fight ends when just one of them dies
* The Ongyo-Ki check's boss is immune to reflected damage


Other Changes
* Pierce has been added to the regular skill pool
* Recarmdra has been removed from magatamas
* Hint messages have been added for Specter 2 and Specter 3
* The boss at Kagutsuchi's check is revealed when using the yahiro-no-himorogi
* The warning message for a field model not found has had the boss's name removed
* The substitute for bosses with no field model has been changed from Vishnu to Mothman


Version 0.2.1:
* Luficer is no longer in the randomizer
* Ongyo-Ki now has 1/4 hp, exp, and macca to match having to kill all 4 replicas
* Albion and Kagutsuchi's check now have increased hp to match Kagutsuchi's phases and Albion's summons
* Locked specter 2's mp to 40
* Bishamon 1 check requires all 3 amala temple bosses to be beaten to so it is no longer required to complete a seed
* Added config flag "t" for vanilla tower of kagutsuchi
* Various logic changes to match the more open-nature of the randomizer, while ensuring there isn't too
big of a leap in difficulty
* Added item Ongyo-Key at id 0x97 to open ikebukuro tunnel. It is in logic, however, the tunnel itself is not blocked
until the item is obtained
* (From last patch, forgot to include in changes) Demons without unique skills have a 10% chance to gain one.
* If there are multiple enemies at the Ongyo-Ki check, AOE attacks will miss, and attacking a single enemy
removes the others from the field. Any enemy can be targeted, there are no illusions.

version 0.2.2
* Ahriman and Noah's checks now work properly, instead of using Metatron and Beelzebub's check
* Specter 2's starting mp is fixed to 29, max mp is uncapped

* Muspell is no longer a valid prerequisite to ailment-based bosses

version 0.2.3

and Phase Shift

version 0.2.4
*Specter 1's reward fixed
*Girimekhala check now gives the correct amount of exp
*More settings added to config file. They can now be changed outside of the program, 
but not much else is done with them yet
