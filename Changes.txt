version 0.3.1
*Several cutscenes have been shortened or skipped
*New Flags for Boss cutscenes have been added. You can skip all of them, watch the cutscenes to see funny new models, or choose Balanced to watch shorter boss cutscenes while skipping longer ones.
*New Difficulty Flag - Low Level: Random encounters will not give EXP. Play at your own risk. Hard mode may softlock you at Forneus/Matador.
*You no longer need to take Pixie to Yoyogi Park
*You no longer need to visit Hijiri's rooms in Amala network 1
*You now start with the moon and star keys
*Flipping any switch in the second half of the Dante chase will activate all three switches
*The 250k macca in cursed hallway is back
*Bugfix: Entering Gozu-Tennoh's room no longer causes several bad things to happen such as softlocking
*Known Bug: Rarely, the randomizer may crash instead of generating a file. If this happens, try again with a different seed

version 0.3.0
*The Labyrinth of Amala is now open. 3 key items are randomized that unlock Kalpas 2, 3, and 4/5. Kalpa 1 will always be unlocked from Matador check. The star key will always be in the collector Manikin's shop. Cursed hallway will not give you 250000 Macca. Only the closest one of Dante's switches needs to be activated. For the second group, it's the one on the left. Beware of entering the other switch rooms as Dante will chase you and reset all the switches if he touches you. The Magic and Agility doors in Kalpa 5 will only require 15 in the stat instead of 25/20. All kalpa tunnels are removed except for Hell's Vault.
*The Pyramidion (Yahiro no Himorogi) is now randomized by default
*New Starting Pixie Flags - Balanced, Random, and Low Level. Choose Balanced to set Pixie's level between 40 and 60. Low Level flag is not recommended for beginners
*New Flags for Better Skill Mutations - Standard, Random, and Unique. No more Agi to Maragi or Dark Might to Might. Standard gives a curated list of skill mutations that is relatively close to vanilla. Random chooses from a bigger selection of mutations, and Unique allows skills to change into unique skills, although this can make fusion worse.
*New Ending Selector Flags - TDE Mode has been moved here and renamed to Auto TDE. These flags will be set when you lower ToK, which will close off Labyrinth of Amala
*New Logic Flags - Vanilla Menoras, No Progression in Labyrinth of Amala, Vanilla Pyramidion, Open Yurakucho Tunnel, and Open Ikebukuro Tunnel
*Hint messages have been added for all bosses except in the Bandou shrine. Unusually placed hints are: Surt - check his statue. Mada, Mot, Mithra, and Samael - given by previous diet building bosses. Berith - Given by Eligor on same floor. Ahriman, Noah, and Baal Avatar - given by the manikin/soul/dominion outside their boss rooms. Ongyo-Ki and Mara - enter their room early.
*All key items now have hint messages. Menorahs - Check their pedastal in LoA. Ongyo-Key - Try to enter Ikebukuro tunnel. Eggplant - Enter Mara's room early. Yahiro no Himorogi - Enter the central temple early. Apocalypse Stone - Talk to Arahabaki by the tunnel to the room with the riders cutscene. Golden Goblet - Talk to the pixie next to the Yoyogi park terminal (Incubus is missing, so it can't be him)
*More boss field models and names are randomzied
*Generation logic has been tweaked with the goal of giving more route variety. As part of this, beating the Thor gauntlet will automatically unlock the Kabukicho Prison terminal so you do not get walled by a difficult boss at Dante 1's check
*Enemies have remembered how to use Gathering
*Demi-fiend now holds a spoon
*Marogareh now keeps its starting stats to give +2 str/vit for the tutorial
*Black Frost can no longer spawn in the first area

*Futomimi and Archangels drop 2 separate rewards instead of sharing one
*Kagutsuchi may now drop rewards wherever he is
*The Koppa and Incubus fight now uses their randomized replacements
*Anti-Expel and Anti-Death are no longer vanilla on Magatamas
*Bugfix: Tutorial demons can no longer be fused to crash the game. All hail Devil Preta and Hallel Kodama
*Bugfix: Bishamon 1 and Mithra checks now drop key items properly. All checks have been verified to drop key items correctly, so the Bishamon 1 check no longer gives all three keys.
*Bugfix: The Futomimi/Archangels check will no longer drop an extra magatama
*Known Bug: Orthrus and Yaksini's dialogue box names are swapped

version 0.2.5
*New Flag: TDE Mode - Allows you to inherit pierce from Marogareh and fight Lucifer after Kagutsuchi
*If an Amala temple key fails to drop when it's supposed to, you can now fight the Bishamon 1 check to receive all 3 keys to prevent being softlocked. Text when collecting the Kimon Stone is changed to reflect this. This is not in intended logic and will be removed once all of the key item drop glitches are found and patched out.
*After triggering the descent of ToK, the Marunouchi terminal will automatically unlock for teleportation.
*Bugfix: The Futomimi/Archangels check now drops key items properly
*Bugfix: When Girimehkala is vanilla, he will now properly drop magatamas

version 0.2.4
*Specter 1's reward fixed
*Girimekhala check now gives the correct amount of exp
*More settings added to config file. They can now be changed outside of the program, 
but not much else is done with them yet
*Flag 'e' added for enemy skill scaling, and all skills are now assigned a level

version 0.2.3
* Ongyo-Ki's exp and macca decreased

and Phase Shift

* Two music flags have been added: m for random boss music, and l for location based boss music
* The odds of a demon with no unique skills gaining 1 has been lowered form 10% to 7%
* Muspell is no longer a valid prerequisite to ailment-based bosses

Version 0.2.1:
* Luficer is no longer in the randomizer
* Ongyo-Ki now has 1/4 hp, exp, and macca to match having to kill all 4 replicas
* Albion and Kagutsuchi's check now have increased hp to match Kagutsuchi's phases and Albion's summons
* Locked specter 2's mp to 40
* Bishamon 1 check requires all 3 amala temple bosses to be beaten to so it is no longer required to complete a seed
* Added config flag "t" for vanilla tower of kagutsuchi
* Various logic changes to match the more open-nature of the randomizer, while ensuring there isn't too
big of a leap in difficulty
* Added item Ongyo-Key at id 0x97 to open ikebukuro tunnel. It is in logic, however, the tunnel itself is not blocked
until the item is obtained
* (From last patch, forgot to include in changes) Demons without unique skills have a 10% chance to gain one.
* If there are multiple enemies at the Ongyo-Ki check, AOE attacks will miss, and attacking a single enemy
removes the others from the field. Any enemy can be targeted, there are no illusions.

Logic
