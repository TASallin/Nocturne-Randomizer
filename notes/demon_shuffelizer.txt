All vanilla demon names and levels are set in a list
If pixie is balanced, choose a level for pixie first
When a demon is added, remove from the level and name list
Create the element matrix and choose 4 races that fuse into the elements
Set levels for the mitamas and elements
Set low levels for 8 demons to fuse into the elements
Determine the base 10 demons and ensure fusions for any other demons that are not in the base 10
Determine all other demons except those who go over fiends
Determine fiends
Now generate the demon permutation:
Prevent phys immune in first 10 demons
Swap demons to make elements, mitamas, and pixie the correct level
Balance all of the new demons
