### Nocturne-Randomizer
This is a randomizer for Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne.
The randomization includes: boss shuffle, enemy/demon shuffle, skill randomization, Magatama and key item drops by bosses, and race randomizer for fusion logic.
We are currently in the alpha/beta stages, and the randomizer itself is not complete with Labyrinth of Amala being blocked off. Expect changes to be frequent and game balance to be shaky.
The list of added features and changes to the randomizer can be seen on this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZ_aiLmRK1lYKKDy6A23m2iAVeU1wcVut1-mGM4vkLM
